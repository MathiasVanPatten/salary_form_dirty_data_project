 # Salary Survey to Tableau Dashboard

 This project took a salary survey with about 28000 respondents from 2021, ([here](https://www.askamanager.org/2021/04/how-much-money-do-you-make-4.html)), cleaned up the free-form text fields, and turned the cleaned data into an interactive dashboard in Tableau.

 The Jupyter notebook main.ipynb is responsible for turning the raw CSV from that survey into the cleaned CSV used to make the Tableau dashboard. It also has the walkthrough of how I did the data cleaning.

 The Tableau dashboard is [here]( https://public.tableau.com/shared/5WWMKGRK5?:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link). The idea was more to make an easy to use overall view of the important parts of the data, not so much to make a complete presentation.
